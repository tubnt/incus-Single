All 17 database tables covered with backend APIs and frontend pages. Features: VM lifecycle, console, snapshots, monitoring (Recharts), SSH keys, products, tickets, orders/billing, invoices, audit logs, API tokens with Bearer auth. Deployed at vmc.5ok.co.

## 2026-04-15 17:40 [decision]

PLAN-005 drafted: full-stack refactor to pma-web (shadcn/ui sidebar layout, ThemeProvider, feature hooks, ESLint, Vitest) and pma-go (golangci-lint, validator, consistent responses, Taskfile) standards. sqlc migration deferred.

## 2026-04-15 18:00 [decision]

Product direction clarified: internal private cloud first, external API later. PLAN-006 drafted: infrastructure automation — VM auto-failover (Incus cluster.healing_threshold), node management (SSH-automated add/remove), standalone host support (DB-stored config). Auto-deploy new cluster deferred to Phase 6D. Directory cleanup: deleted 17,885 lines of dead code (paymenter, ai-gateway, console-proxy, screenshots), unified all docs under root /docs/.
